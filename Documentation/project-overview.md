# TechPrep AI: Technical Interview Preparation Assistant
## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
TechPrep AI aims to revolutionize how software engineers prepare for technical interviews by providing a personalized, AI-driven preparation experience that adapts to each candidate's background and career goals. By analyzing the user's resume and creating customized learning paths, we help engineers bridge the gap between their current skills and their dream job requirements.

### Problem Statement
Technical interviews in the software industry are complex, requiring deep preparation across multiple dimensions: algorithmic problem-solving, system design, behavioral questions, and specific technology expertise. Current solutions are often:
- Generic and not personalized to individual experience levels
- Lacking in real-time feedback and guidance
- Unable to adapt to a candidate's specific weaknesses
- Not comprehensive enough to cover all aspects of technical interviews

### Solution
TechPrep AI provides an intelligent interview preparation platform that:
- Analyzes resumes to understand the candidate's current skill level
- Creates personalized learning paths based on target roles
- Offers interactive mock interviews with real-time feedback
- Generates custom flashcards for key concepts
- Tracks progress and adapts to learning patterns

### Target Audience
Primary focus: Software engineers preparing for technical interviews, specifically:
- Junior to mid-level developers seeking advancement
- Engineers transitioning between tech stacks
- Career switchers moving into software development
- Experienced developers preparing for senior roles

### Success Metrics
1. User Achievement:
   - 80% of users report feeling more confident after preparation
